            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I have a background in IT that stretches back to 1984. I have worked extensively with relational databases
                and have worked for big name firms such as Unisys. I had to take some time away from the world of IT for
                family reasons, but recently decided to use CodeNation to help me refresh my skills for the modern
                workplace. I have learnt some Python basics which I have put to use successfully within the course.

                This website is the first that I have created. I am using basic HTML commands to create the contents
            </p>        

            <p>
                My pastimes include Photography, watching films, listening to music and keeping engaged with various websites
                including Youtube.
