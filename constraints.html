                Copyright is a potential source of risk for website development. Areas of potential copyright infringement include:-
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Images</li>
                <li>Source Code</li>
                <li>Platform Licensing</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                Images that are not free stock photos may be picked up by copyright detection tools, and if they are then the website
                may be subject to a copyright claim against it. The actual source code behind websites can be subject to the same risks.
                Some applications may be included within a website under a license. If the scope of the implementation exceeds the terms
                of the license for the application then that becomes another source of risk.
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other constraints include bearing in mind that the website may be visited on a number of different devices (eg laptop, phone,
                tablet) and the site should work for as many devices as possible.
            </p> 
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            
            <img src="./accessibility.jpg" alt="" height="350">

            <p>         
                Accessibility issues that should be addressed include:-
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Impairment</li>
                    <li>Blindness</li>
                    <li>Hearing Impairment</li>
                    <li>People who struggle to use mouse and/or keyboard</li>
                    <li>People who find reading difficult</li>
                </ul>
                
                To resolve these issues the following can be done:-
                
                Font size, style and colour selections can make text easier to read
                Screen readers can assist the blind, so ensuring the screen reader is working correctly is of assistance.
                Audio commentary may be needed to assist with video content
                subtitles may assist the hard of hearing
                Ensuring tabbing around a screen works smoothly will be useful
                Ensuring that large blocks of text are broken up to assist with the page's readability
