            <p>
                Visual Code editor has been very useful indeed in the creation of HTML and CSS code. Ther autofill,
                alignment and colour coding are all very useful elements that make code extremly easy to read.
            </p>

            <p>
                Trello has been a very simple and effective means of keeping track of the project build items. It is very easy to apply to the Kanban method means it is in line with industry standards.               
            </p>

            <p>
                The use of Github to regularly upload code to a safe place for backup and version control purposes has been very useful.

            </h3>

            <p>
                I am pleased with the look and feel of the website. Certain elements of the website were developed prior to me learning about CSS so they were designed to utilise CSS in an optimum manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Strengths of my website are that it is quite simply laid out. It is not overly verbose when describing the concepts that form each page on the website.
            </p>

                3.4 Testing Digital Software
            </h3>

            <p>
                The testing of digital software is entirely dependant on the complexity involved in the software. If the software has lots of if..else conditions embedded within it
                then there will need to be a plan drawn up to test each combination of variables so all permutations are tested. When it comes to websites on the internet then plans
                need to be made to ensure the site can handle multiple different browsers and devices.
