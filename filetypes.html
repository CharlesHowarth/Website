                HTML is the core of websites as it covers the basic text content for websites. and it tells the web browser
                how to display text, images, videos etc on a web page.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the file type that will control the manner in which text is presented. It provides a centralised
                set of definitions that multiple pages can adopt, consequently saving the need to define styles for each page.
