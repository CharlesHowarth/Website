                Where there is an industry standard in place, then it is only sensible to adopt that standard. For example, Slack and Trello are widely used
                and have proven track records so it is desirable to incorporate these tools in digital projects. Where there is less clarity, i.e. there is more
                than one dependable solution, then several considerations are factored in.

                When the relative merits of one language over another are assessed within these categories, it should be easier to determine which language
                is more suitable for your project.

                Trello has been a very useful tool for breaking down projects into manageable units. I have used it for both the Python RPG project and to
                manage the necessary items for building the website for the CodeNation course.

                Github is very useful for having good version control over code.
                The pull request function ensures that conflict will not occur through multiple people working on the same code at once, and the History
                option allows the user to view versions of code that have been submitted as development proceeds. Ensuring the process is in place to compel
                users to keep Trello and GitHub up to date is a crucial requirement.
